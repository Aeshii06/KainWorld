    <center><h1 class="aboutus">About Us</h1></center>
    <p>We are a group of grade 11 students from Parañaque Science High School that aims to advocate the hunger and malnutrition problem in the Philippines. Our group believes that every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop fully and maintain their physical and mental faculties. All of us have a right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger. <br> <br> Through our advocacy here kain.world we aim to disseminate and inform thousands of Filipinos about the rampant hunger and malnutrition problem present in the poorer areas of the Philippines. Through Kain.World you can be redirected to Non-Government Organizations(NGOs) and Charities in the Philippines responsible for feeding and helping hundreds of families each year. <br> <br> This website will serve as a gateway to a broader perspective of the world of  the poor and hungry in the country and guide you to advocacies, charities and NGOs where your donations can make a difference.</p>

                <p1>I believe that we are all literary chameleons and I think it’s fascinating. It’s just a continuation of the idea that we are so many things, all the time. And I know it can be really overwhelming figuring out who to be, and when. Who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go. I have some good news: it’s totally up to you. With that, I chose to advocate for something that I know will be helpful not only to the society but also to myself as i grow to be a better person.</p1>
